        What is your sky-blue colour? Japanese’s nomenclature of traditional
        colour shows us a different view about the world we see. The Japanese
        names a bright blue colour as ‘sky blue’ – sora (空), and a light blue
        colour as ‘water’– mizu (水). The nomenclature for colours in Japanese
        is not only from nature or materials they use in daily life, but also
        from the ingredients and techniques used in the dye industry, or even
        the family names that are associated with the discovery history of the
        related colours, and there are more names that rather imply a derivation
        from Buddhist philosophy. The Japanese language, which was developed and
        transformed from traditional Chinese is aesthetic, philosophical and
        precise. The colour names in Japanese are a proof not only of the
        aesthetic language itself, but also a social phenomenon of Japanese
        culture. The essay will elaborate on this by a presentation of the
        colours of red, yellow, green, blue, black and white. From each chapter,
        readers will be guided through the journey to understand not only the
        traditional colour nomenclature in Japanese (日本の伝統色), but also the
        Japanese culture via literature, poetry, and even personal memories.

        <p class="para-text">
          There is a hidden palette of reds in nature: clay, plants, berries,
          bark, flowers, and minerals
          <span class="refer-footer-num footer-red">1</span>, and the
          nomenclature for red, along with green, is a straightforward way of
          understanding how the ancient Japanese observed and then named colours
          from nature. For instance, sakura (桜) is the colour of cherry blossom
          petals; ichigo (苺) means strawberry and is also its colour; azuki
          (小豆) means red bean and its colour. Red bean is a symbol for love
          and having many offspring in Chinese culture. In Japan, the lovers
          would eat red bean rice on the day of their meeting with each other’s
          parents, or the newly married couple would put the red beans on their
          wedding bed in order to seek good fortune for their marriage or eating
          red bean rice on celebrative occasions, like Valentine’s Day or
          wedding anniversaries.
        </p>
        <p class="para-text">
          But the red bean is not just symbolising the love between lovers, it
          is also for describing the love for families and friends. One of my
          favourite poems is called Red Beans Grow in South Land by Wang Wei.
          The poem was written in the Tang Dynasty. The red bean here expresses
          the author’s melancholic feelings when he was saying goodbye to his
          friend:
        </p>
        <p class="para-text">
          Some red names were from bird and animal, like toki (鴇), benitobi
          (紅鳶) and kurotobi (黒鳶). The toki is crested ibis in Japanese, and
          the colour of toki is said to be from the colour of the crested ibis’s
          wing <span class="refer-footer-num footer-red">2</span>. Benitobi and
          kurotobi are different tones of toki. In Japanese colour nomenclature,
          by sharing the same suffix of characters, the colours might share the
          same hue but in different tones. The Kanji words猩猩 mean orangutan,
          and the colour syojyohi (猩猩绯), which is a bright orange-red colour,
          is close to the orangutan’s skin colour. There is another saying that
          this is the colour from the performing arts in the Noh Theatre
          <span class="refer-footer-num footer-red">3</span>. The actors in the
          Noh Theatre usually wore costumes in orangutan-skin-like colour on
          stage, as they believed the bright red colour was for scaring monsters
          and protecting people. The syojyohi colour also appears in Dream of
          the Red Chamber, which is a classic Chinese novel written by Cao
          Xueqin in 1760. The syojyohi colour, notably, was the colour from the
          cloak ‘worn’ by the protagonist Jia Baoyu. According to the author,
          also later proved by the textile specialist and historian who studied
          on the novel, which syojyohi colour believed was hard to get from
          dyeing that only the rich and the royals could afford it in Qing
          dynasty. Except be a sign for the high-status people, syojyohi
          coloured cloak is somewhat a bold and contradictory signal challenge
          the traditional social rule which men should be only wearing
          non-bright colour back then. Quite obviously, the colour term of
          syojyohi is referring to the character of Jia Baoyu who was an
          idealistic and passionate, and naïve for love.
        </p>
        <p class="para-text">
          There are colour names taken from dyeing techniques. ‘Zome’ means
          ‘dye’ in Japanese. The names ending with ‘zome’ suggest the colours
          were made from dyeing. Like Ikkonzome (一斤染), ‘Ikkon’ means one
          kilogram, so this colour name suggests that it takes a kilogram of
          safflower to dye this colour. Colour nomenclature in Japanese is not
          always in a straightforward way, indeed, quite opposite, the No.1
          colour list on Nippon Colors – nadeshiko, which comes from the word –
          Yamato Nadeshiko. Yamato is the ancient name of Japan and the majority
          ethnic group of Japanese nowadays. In Japanese, Yamato Nadeshiko is
          the term for describing ‘an idealised woman’, which would be meant
          being kind, humble, respectful, faithful, graceful, quiet, honest,
          polite… Japanese entitled those personalities to nadeshiko. Would this
          pink colour be the choice to describe your ideal woman?
        </p>
        <p class="para-text">
          Not did the colour nomenclature in Japanese is conceptual, but is also
          considered very ‘visual’, for instance, like the colour akebono (曙).
          The kanji character of akebono is the word used to describe the
          sunlight colour that just emerges from the horizon in the morning, and
          it also means ‘hope’, the ancient Japanese gave this bright
          orangy–like red colour a name – ‘the first sunlight of a day’, a
          colour that is for ‘hope’.
        </p>
        <p class="para-text">
          Before I introduce the last name of the red colours, now, please close
          your eyes, take a breath in, feel (and imagine) the smell of the
          sappanwood incense, breathe out, and open your eyes. What colour for
          the sappanwood incense popped up in your mind? This is the colour
          called the sappanwood incense – suoh (蘇芳). It has been suggested the
          suoh is the dye colour from the sappanwood trees
          <span class="refer-footer-num footer-red">4</span>. This is a dark red
          colour, which can be easily mixed with other colours in the dye.
        </p>
        <p class="para-text">
          If you are not a non-Japanese or Chinese native speaker, in order to
          know how the Japanese understand of colour red, then you might would
          take a close look at the kanji word – 赤. The character ‘赤’ combines
          two separated symbols – the fire symbol (火) is underneath the earth
          symbol (土). The ancient Japanese believed both life force and fiery
          energy were coming from the earth. In Japanese language, a person who
          is genuine, kind and has a pure heart is called ‘赤子の心’ (heart of
          red people), Japanese call new born baby –‘赤ちゃん’ (red baby) . As
          in most of cultures, red in Japanese culture, is a bright colour, a
          passionate one, and is positive, so is seductive, dangerous and also
          ‘is a colour with a strange gigantic life, an enigma encompassing
          everything from sunsets to the roseate tint of our insides. Red
          confounds us surely in its many meanings, for it is magic itself.’

              Noh (能) is a form of theatre performance involved in music, dance
              and drama, originating in the 14th century. It is one of the
              culture heritages of Japan, along with Kyogen (known as nogaku),
