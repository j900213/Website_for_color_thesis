            This essay starts from a word – 色 – meaning ‘colour’ in both
            Japanese and Chinese. It is pronounced as ‘Iro’ in Japanese. Colour
            is an element existing in our daily lives. Everyone sees colours,
            even those who are blind. But ‘The perception of colours is partly a
            neuro-biological phenomenon and partly a
            <span class="magic-fade"

            >
            one, which is why it varies in time and space, and is not identical
            in all periods and all societies.’ Dixon echoes this from a
            linguistic point of view: ‘Colour changes with our view of the
            world: not its ability to be seen, but its need to be said. An
            etymonic natural selection: language mutates. The practical value of
            colour terms drives their specificity, and the language evolves to
            reflect the systems in which it is used.’

            I am interested in how colours have been perceived, and also how
            they are called. Beyond the physical connection of retina and brain,
            colours are part of how I see, part of how I am connecting and
            communicating with the
            <span class="magic-fade"
              ><span class="magic-box color-2">world</span></span
            >
            . I see colours as they are, and also something ‘outside of colour,
            yet somehow central to the way we translate it into words. Texture,
            material, moistness and metaphor. The
            <span class="magic-fade"
              ><span class="magic-box color-3">source</span></span
            >, the seed of colour’ is the reason for this essay. I will be
            focusing on a way to translate colours into words. By introducing
            different colours and their nomenclature, which are red, yellow,
            green, blue, and black and white, and to tell the different cultural
            aspects of Japan, through the beauty of colour itself and the way
            that Japanese named those colours.

            of colour nomenclature in Japanese, I use Nippon Colors
            (日本の伝統色) as a guidebook to start my research for this essay.
            Through colour nomenclature, not only did ‘Colour became colour
            through a surface property’, but also the cultural phenomenon of
            Japanese will be explained through those names too, because ‘The
            origin of colors really does appear to be a cultural construction
            and not a natural phenomenon’. The essay is written in response to
            the following questions: How were the traditional colours named in
            Japanese? and what is the difference (or similarity) of the colour
            nomenclature in Japanese from other languages? What were the objects
            used to name the colours? Or when talking about a colour or a type
            of colour, which time period exactly are we referring to? In short,
            what was the logic behind colour nomenclature in Japanese?
