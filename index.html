        What is your sky-blue colour? Japanese’s nomenclature of traditional
        colour shows us a different view about the world we see. The Japanese
        names a bright blue colour as ‘sky blue’ – sora (空), and a light blue
        colour as ‘water’–
        <span class="magic-fade"
          ><span class="magic-box color-1">mizu (水)</span></span
        >. The nomenclature for colours in Japanese is not only from nature or
        materials they use in daily life, but also from the ingredients and
        techniques used in the dye industry, or even the family names that are
        associated with the discovery history of the related colours, and there
        are more names that rather imply a derivation from Buddhist philosophy.
        The Japanese language, which was developed and transformed from
        traditional Chinese is aesthetic, philosophical and precise. The colour
        names in Japanese are a proof not only of the aesthetic language itself,
        but also a social phenomenon of Japanese culture. The essay will
        elaborate on this by a presentation of the colours of red, yellow,
        green, blue, black and white. From each chapter, readers will be guided
        through the journey to understand not only the traditional colour
        nomenclature in Japanese (日本の伝統色), but also the Japanese culture
        via literature, poetry, and even personal memories.

        <h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter 1 —The Red Earth</h2>
        <p class="para-text first-para">
          There is a hidden palette of reds in nature: clay, plants, berries,
          bark, flowers, and minerals
          <span class="refer-footer-num footer-red">1</span>, and the
          nomenclature for red, along with green, is a straightforward way of
          understanding how the ancient Japanese observed and then named colours
          from nature. For instance,
          <span class="magic-fade"
            ><span class="magic-box color-2">sakura (桜)</span></span
          >
          is the colour of cherry blossom petals;
          <span class="magic-fade"
            ><span class="magic-box color-3">ichigo (苺)</span></span
          >

          means strawberry and is also its colour;
          <span class="magic-fade"
            ><span class="magic-box color-4">azuki (小豆)</span></span
          >
          means red bean and its colour. Red bean is a symbol for love and
          having many offspring in Chinese culture. In Japan, the lovers would
          eat red bean rice on the day of their meeting with each other’s
          parents, or the newly married couple would put the red beans on their
          wedding bed in order to seek good fortune for their marriage or eating
          red bean rice on celebrative occasions, like Valentine’s Day or
          wedding anniversaries.
        </p>
        <p class="para-text">
          But the red bean is not just symbolising the love between lovers, it
          is also for describing the love for families and friends. One of my
          favourite poems is called Red Beans Grow in South Land by Wang Wei.
          The poem was written in the Tang Dynasty. The red bean here expresses
          the author’s melancholic feelings when he was saying goodbye to his
          friend:
        </p>
        <div class="quote-wrapper">
          <p class="quote-text">
            Red beans grow in southern land, <br />
            How many loads in spring the trees. <br />
            Gather them till full in your hand, <br />
            They would revive fond memories.
          </p>

          Some red names were from bird and animal, like toki (鴇), benitobi
          (紅鳶) and kurotobi (黒鳶). The toki is crested ibis in Japanese, and
          the colour of toki is said to be from the colour of the crested ibis’s
          wing <span class="refer-footer-num footer-red">2</span>. Benitobi and
          kurotobi are different tones of toki. In Japanese colour nomenclature,
          by sharing the same suffix of characters, the colours might share the
          same hue but in different tones. The Kanji words猩猩 mean orangutan,
          and the colour
          <span class="magic-fade"
            ><span class="magic-box color-5">syojyohi (猩猩绯)</span></span
          >, which is a bright orange-red colour, is close to the orangutan’s
          skin colour. There is another saying that this is the colour from the
          performing arts in the Noh Theatre
          <span class="refer-footer-num footer-red">3</span>. The actors in the
          Noh Theatre usually wore costumes in orangutan-skin-like colour on
          stage, as they believed the bright red colour was for scaring monsters
          and protecting people. The syojyohi colour also appears in Dream of
          the Red Chamber, which is a classic Chinese novel written by Cao
          Xueqin in 1760. The syojyohi colour, notably, was the colour from the
          cloak ‘worn’ by the protagonist Jia Baoyu. According to the author,
          also later proved by the textile specialist and historian who studied
          on the novel, which syojyohi colour believed was hard to get from
          dyeing that only the rich and the royals could afford it in Qing
          dynasty. Except be a sign for the high-status people, syojyohi
          coloured cloak is somewhat a bold and contradictory signal challenge
          the traditional social rule which men should be only wearing
          non-bright colour back then. Quite obviously, the colour term of
          syojyohi is referring to the character of Jia Baoyu who was an
          idealistic and passionate, and naïve for love.
        </p>
        <p class="para-text">
          There are colour names taken from dyeing techniques. ‘Zome’ means
          ‘dye’ in Japanese. The names ending with ‘zome’ suggest the colours
          were made from dyeing. Like
          <span class="magic-fade"
            ><span class="magic-box color-6">Ikkonzome (一斤染)</span></span
          >, ‘Ikkon’ means one kilogram, so this colour name suggests that it
          takes a kilogram of safflower to dye this colour. Colour nomenclature
          in Japanese is not always in a straightforward way, indeed, quite
          opposite, the No.1 colour list on Nippon Colors – nadeshiko, which
          comes from the word – Yamato Nadeshiko. Yamato is the ancient name of
          Japan and the majority ethnic group of Japanese nowadays. In Japanese,
          Yamato Nadeshiko is the term for describing ‘an idealised woman’,
          which would be meant being kind, humble, respectful, faithful,
          graceful, quiet, honest, polite… Japanese entitled those personalities
          to nadeshiko. Would this pink colour be the choice to describe your
          ideal woman?
        </p>
        <p class="para-text">
          Not did the colour nomenclature in Japanese is conceptual, but is also
          considered very ‘visual’, for instance, like the colour
          <span class="magic-fade"
            ><span class="magic-box color-7">akebono (曙)</span></span
          >. The kanji character of akebono is the word used to describe the
          sunlight colour that just emerges from the horizon in the morning, and
          it also means ‘hope’, the ancient Japanese gave this bright
          orangy–like red colour a name – ‘the first sunlight of a day’, a
          colour that is for ‘hope’.
        </p>
        <p class="para-text">
          Before I introduce the last name of the red colours, now, please close
          your eyes, take a breath in, feel (and imagine) the smell of the
          sappanwood incense, breathe out, and open your eyes. What colour for
          the sappanwood incense popped up in your mind? This is the colour
          called the sappanwood incense –
          <span class="magic-fade"
            ><span class="magic-box color-8">suoh (蘇芳)</span></span
          >. It has been suggested the suoh is the dye colour from the
          sappanwood trees <span class="refer-footer-num footer-red">4</span>.
          This is a dark red colour, which can be easily mixed with other
          colours in the dye.
        </p>
        <p class="para-text">
          If you are not a non-Japanese or Chinese native speaker, in order to
          know how the Japanese understand of colour red, then you might would
          take a close look at the kanji word – 赤. The character ‘<span
            class="magic-fade"
            ><span class="magic-box color-9">赤</span></span
          >’ combines two separated symbols – the fire symbol (火) is underneath
          the earth symbol (土). The ancient Japanese believed both life force
          and fiery energy were coming from the earth. In Japanese language, a
          person who is genuine, kind and has a pure heart is called ‘赤子の心’
          (heart of red people), Japanese call new born baby –‘赤ちゃん’ (red
          baby) . As in most of cultures, red in Japanese culture, is a bright
          colour, a passionate one, and is positive, so is seductive, dangerous
          and also ‘is a colour with a strange gigantic life, an enigma
          encompassing everything from sunsets to the roseate tint of our
          insides. Red confounds us surely in its many meanings, for it is magic
          itself.’

          There was a small field full of rapeseed flowers near my childhood
          house in the countryside. In springtime, I would go to the field with
          friends and play in there. If the weather was sunny enough, I would
          meet more schoolmates there. It wasn’t something really special, it
          was just two or three girls enjoying their time running around the
          field outside school. The field and the time I spent with friends were
          the memories to remind me of the place I used to live. Not long after
          I joined the school, my father changed his job, so our family moved
          from there to Chongqing where skyscrapers take over the skyline.

        <p class="para-text">
          I made some new friends after I joined the new school, and adapted to
          the new routine quickly. Sometimes, however, I missed the field where
          I could run, and I thought I even missed the smell of rapeseed flowers
          which I didn’t really like at first. In Chongqing, life is a little
          different than in the countryside. As a primary school student, I used
          to get up at six o’clock every morning to catch the school bus an hour
          later, and then took the school bus back home after five o’clock, and
          then wrote homework in the evening. On the weekend, I had to go to
          extracurricular classes to learn painting and dancing. I did not have
          much time to enjoy nature, besides, there wasn’t any, it was just
          buildings after buildings on the street of our house.

        <p class="para-text">
          Even now, whenever I recall the time I spent in the countryside as a
          child, the bright yellow colour of rapeseed flowers always pops up in
          front of my eyes. I didn’t know there is a special name for the colour
          of the rapeseed flowers until I found it in Japanese, which is ‘<span
            class="magic-fade"
            ><span class="magic-box color-10">nanohana (菜の花)</span></span
          >’. The colour of nanohana is exactly the same colour I saw in the
          field in my childhood. Nanohana, therefore, is a colour full of happy
          memories to me. It is a vibrant, childlike colour. Whenever I say
          na-no-hana, 菜–の–花, I feel, the word, the word flies into the air,
          and flies over the sky, then brings me to the rapeseed flowers field
          of菜–の–花.

          Ludwig Wittgenstein once said: ‘if we are asked what the words red,
          yellow, blue, and green mean, we can of course immediately point to
          things that are those colors. But our capacity to explain the meaning
          of those words goes no further,’
          <span class="refer-footer-num footer-orange">8</span> and Pastoureau
          echoes this by saying, ‘The case of yellow is by no means unique. The
          same comment could be made regarding any color whatsoever.’
          <span class="refer-footer-num footer-orange">9</span> It is true that
          our verbal languages have a limitation in explaining the colour terms
          in greater depth and in a philosophical way. But would this be the
          point that we are using colour as the medium to create art,
          craftsmanship works, and dye fabrics? Do we always need to be able to
          translate the colours we see into words? Mark Rothko claimed, ‘I'm not
          an abstractionist. I'm not interested in the relationship of color or
          form or anything else. I'm interested only in expressing basic human
          emotions: tragedy, ecstasy, doom, and so on.’<span

          Does language help us understand the world that is already complex,
          dynamic, and diverse? Do we feel we have a more intimate relationship
          with colours if they are called by words? And if the colours are
          without nomenclature, like those Pantone numbers, do we still perceive
          and feel those colours the same way?

          In the V&A’s Japan collection, it displays the Yoshioka Dyeing
          Workshop’s donation of dyed silks. The fabrics are displayed by the
          colour hues. It is very surprising to see how subtle the differences
          can be between each colour that was created by the dyeing techniques.
          The late Sachio Yoshioka, who was the fifth-generation head of Kyoto’s
          Somenotsukasa Yoshioka dye workshop, said he wanted to ‘save these
          almost forgotten skills from extinction, by using age-old natural
          dyeing techniques in order to bring colours to life, and create the
          ‘forgotten’ colours like those found on textiles preserved in the
          eighth-century Shosoin Imperial Repository in Nara, and he ‘researched
          from historical documents and textile samples to continue and recreate
          colours which were used throughout Japan’s history’.
          <span class="refer-footer-num footer-orange">11</span> In the display,
          there was a book with detailed colour descriptions which were used for
          making different layers of kimono. Those colours and the words which
          were appearing on the book pages, is an evidence of how the ancient
          Japanese once saw the colours. Despite what Mr. Yoshioka did and his
          Yoshioka Dyeing Workshop is doing – to ensure the ‘forgotten’ colours
          will be saved and re-created, those colours may never appear the same
          again as they were, because the materials used for dyeing vary from
          time to time. But the words which recorded the nomenclature of colours
          and how they have been created, will never fade. The words stay on the
          pages, become the history itself.

          The nomenclature of green colours mostly was named from natures
          because Japanese have had centuries of contact with trees and plants,
          through gardening and the art of floral arrangement.
          <span class="refer-footer-num footer-green">12</span> Japanese have
          taken the symbolic meaning of trees and plants from nature in their
          daily life and uses for art, for instance, bamboo is a symbol of
          longevity, being evergreen and virtuous, of fidelity and constancy;
          pine stands for strength, endurance and also longevity; willow has
          long been a favourite plant in Japanese gardening and it is the symbol
          for a female, with the same use for flowers. A Chinese idiom – ‘red
          flowers and green willow’ (花红柳绿), depicts a spring scene. It can
          also be used to refer to the colourful world. As Foucault put:

            the art of language was a way of “making sign” – of simultaneously
            signifying something and arranging signs around those things; an art
            of naming, therefore, and then, by means of a reduplication both
            demonstrative and decorative, or capturing the name, of enclosing
            and concealing it, of designating it in turn by other names that
            were the deferred presence of the first name, its secondary sign,
            its figuration, its rhetorical panoply.

          Last time when I was in the Nara area with a group of friends, we were
          there to attended the Gozan no Okuribi (五山送り火in Japanese)
          Festival, where we got a chance to dress-up and wear yukata.
          <span class="refer-footer-num footer-green">14</span> The festival is
          held annually in August, and on the festival day, there is a ritual of
          setting up bonfires in the evening.
          <span class="refer-footer-num footer-green">15</span> Apart from
          attending the festival celebration, one of our plans during the stay
          was to visit the Tōdaiji Temple. We followed the plan and made sure we
          get there in the earlier morning before the weather gets too hot. But
          it was in August, I felt my body was swallowed by the sweltering
          weather as soon as I away from the air-conditioner. Although It was
          just a fifteen minutes’ walk from the car parking place to the gate of
          the Tōdaiji Temple, I started to feel dizzy because of dehydration
          from the sun. We had no idea where the Tōdaiji Temple was but hoped to
          find it by following the crowds, the longer we walked, the Iess
          patience I had. Finally, after we turned towards the left corner of
          the temple, we entered onto a small pathway, where I saw the Great
          Buddha Hall for the first time. I walked slowly in front of the hall
          and looking at it sitting there tranquilly under the blue sky, my
          heart started pounding, and I was completely shocked by its beauty.
          The Great Buddha Hall surrounded by trees, and neatly trimmed green
          grasses in front of it, with mountains sat behind. At that very
          moment, I felt the surroundings were suddenly muted, just me standing
          in front of the Buddha Hall. A sense of calm came over me, I started
          to feel the breeze blowing in my hair.
        </p>
        <p class="para-text">
          After we visited the Tōdaiji Temple, we drove to the restaurant we
          booked in advance which was in the countryside of Nara. A small but
          decent restaurant owned by a middle-aged couple. We were all exhausted
          and hungry after the Tōdaiji Temple. A palisade sat in the front door
          of the restaurant. A small pathway that was covered by stones led us
          into the restaurant. A pair of dyed dark blue short curtains (‘noren’
          in Japanese) hung above the entrance. We had to draw the curtain open
          and take off our shoes and left them in the entrance hall before we
          could get inside. It was a very small restaurant that only three
          tables in total, the floor was covered with tatamis without chairs. We
          all ordered soba noodles for lunch, well, because that was the only
          thing on the menu. A suggested way to eat soba is having it served
          cold and mixed with wasabi and soy sauce. Soba noodle is one of the
          most common dishes in the summer for the Japanese. I ordered the
          matcha-flavoured soba, and it came with ice on top. It was the first
          time I had green tea favoured soba. It tasted fresh, especially with
          the lime soup sauce mixed with it. I sat on the tatamis, which I had
          to adjust the body positions all the time, my stomach felt squeezed
          and I feel uncomfortable, so I started to look at the green plate in
          front of me to distract myself from pain, the plate covered with a
          light green colour mixed with blue and brown colours. I had just
          learnt this colour was called
          <span class="magic-fade"
            ><span class="magic-box color-11">sabiseiji (錆青磁)</span></span
          >
          during the trip. The colour came from the ceramic making process. By
          adding an amount of iron into clay, the colour started appearing on
          the jar, so the name came from ‘iron-green-ceramic’ (錆-青-磁).
        </p>
        <p class="para-text">
          Then I started counting how many ‘greens’ I encountered during the
          trip: Tōdaiji green; matcha-green; wasabi-green; Japanese green (blue)
          traffic lights; seasoning green tea of Osaka; different shades of
          green on the yukata I was wearing on the Gozan no Okuribi festival
          night; Lemon green colour on the geta shoes I saw on an old lady
          walking on the street in the old town of Kyoto, so on and on…

          There is a word (or phrase) called 一期一会（いちごいちえ）in
          Japanese, meaning we only have once in a lifetime chance to witness
          something or meet someone. The word was used for the tea ceremony,
          which has been taught by the tea master Sen no Rikyu (千利休).
          <span class="refer-footer-num footer-green">16</span> He told his
          apprentices that making a cup tea to serve the customers (or friends)
          is like 一期一会 because we can never know if we will be meeting the
          people in front of us again, so that to make as the most perfect tea
          as possible is the duty of a tea master. By sharing the tea, both tea
          master and people who are been served shared moments of life together,
          even life separate people apart, but the memory lasts, possibly
          forever.

              which two of them are identical. The ceremony is a way of honoring

          I once participated in a dyeing workshop when I was fourteen or
          fifteen. We were asked to dye a small piece of white fabric into a
          light blue colour fabric. The workshop was intended to teach very
          basic dyeing techniques, for instance, how long it takes for the
          fabric to soak the colour. After finishing the dyeing, we hanged our
          work on the wall. It turned out that, despite the techniques we had
          learnt, none of our fabrics were dyed evenly. There were different
          shades within my small fabric, it was not a successful piece, but what
          I enjoyed was the dyeing experience.

          People like the colour blue. Back to school, I remember most of my
          classmates mentioned that blue was their favourite colour when our
          teacher asked us, though it has never been mine. In recent opinion
          polls on colour preference in Western Europe, in answer to the
          question, ‘which is your favourite’, blue topped the list, while
          yellow (still and always) remains the least liked one. The result has
          stayed the same since the end of the nineteenth century.<span

          Goethe described blue, and yellow too, in his book The Sorrows of
          Young Werther which was published in 1774, ‘It was a difficult
          decision for me to abandon my simple blue dress coat in which I first
          danced with Lotte, but it was becoming quite threadbare. Besides, I
          had had one made exactly like it, even to the collar and facings, and
          another yellow vest and trousers to go with it.’<span

            The literature of the Englightment and later of the early Romantic

            example of this is Werther’s famous blue-and-yellow outfit […] Blue
            along with yellow is one of the poles of Goethe’s color system. He

          From a linguistic point of view, ‘Yellow, constituted the negative
          pole, because it is a passive, weak and cold color, while blue was
          always charged with a positive association and represented the
          opposite pole, because it is an active, warm, and luminous
          color.’<span class="refer-footer-num footer-blue">20</span>
          Look to the East, the meaning of the yellow-blue pair is reversed:
          yellow is a vigorous and powerful colour, while blue is cold and weak.

          Speaking about the relationship between blue and the sky, there is a
          colour name for blue called
          <span class="magic-fade"
            ><span class="magic-box color-12">‘sora’ (空)</span></span
          >, in Japanese, sora means ‘sky’. Very recently, I briefly talked to
          Mr. Jiang Xun at an event. Mr. Jiang is an author, art critic and
          painter from Taiwan. He is also an expert in colour studies. One of
          his research areas is studying the colours from Dream of the Red
          Chamber, which he has been doing for over thirty years. He mentioned
          that he has not yet figured out what a blue colour called ‘lean in’
          (靠色) is in the book. There is a suggestion that this colour is from
          a blue dye and is a pale blue colour.<span
            class="refer-footer-num footer-blue"
            >21</span

          Mr. Jiang explained to me that:
        </p>
        <div class="quote-wrapper">
          <p class="quote-text">
            The word ‘lean (靠)’ might mean ‘inside of the jar’ (in the book).
            And the dyed pale blue colour might be from the colour that was left
            over inside a jar, and because the soaking time for fabrics is very
            short, this dyed blue colour can be as lightest as possible. This
            colour is nearly like white colour.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p class="para-text">
          But then he added, ‘it’s just a possibility’. After hearing Mr.
          Jiang’s viewpoint on the colour of ‘lean in’, I found there is a
          similar name for a blue colour in Japanese –
          <span class="magic-fade"
            ><span class="magic-box color-13">kamenozoki (瓶覗)</span></span
          >. Kamenozoki is a pale greenish-blue colour. The kanji characters
          literally mean ‘peeking inside the jar’, which may suggest this colour
          is made from dyeing.

          The word for indigo blue in Chinese and Japanese is ai (藍), as a dye

          The blue dye appeared as early as the ninth century in Japan. In

          <span class="magic-fade"
            ><span class="magic-box color-14">hanada (縹)</span></span
          >: ‘a light or dark blue tinged with pink, for door curtains, usually

            ><span class="magic-box color-15">mizu (水)</span></span
          >, meaning water, to name one of the blues. Mizu is said to refer to
          the sea in naming it as blue, or some say that in Japan, water is very
          clean because it comes from the melted snow water from high mountains,
          and looks blue.<span class="refer-footer-num footer-blue">25</span>
          The mizu blue reminds me of the study Gladstone did on blue when he
          was reading of Homer. Gladstone questioned if Homer was blind or if he
          had the same perception as normal people because he described the
          sea’s colour as ‘wine-like’. That led Gladstone to further wonder if
          ancient Greek people had the same structure of retina as we have
          today. But we know that nothing has changed in the eye’s anatomy over
          the last millennia.<span class="refer-footer-num footer-blue"

          It wasn’t the Greek’s physiologically undeveloped colour vision, but
          rather the ancient Greeks had limited words to describe the colours
          they see – particularly for ‘blue’.<span
            class="refer-footer-num footer-blue"
            >27</span

          Or in Pastoureau’s words, ‘ancient Greek had a different vocabulary
          for what they saw.’<span class="refer-footer-num footer-blue"

        </p>
        <p class="para-text">
          There are similarities in nomenclature with blue between the Japanese
          and ancient Latin languages, ‘as Goetz and many others assumed, Latin
          speakers did not distinguish blue from green’.<span
            class="refer-footer-num footer-blue"
            >29</span
          >
          Or at least, the nomenclature of blue borrowed the words from green,
          in Japanese. Like the word 葱 (negi) means spring onion, but is also
          used for describing blue. From light indigo –
          <span class="magic-fade"
            ><span class="magic-box color-16">asagi (浅葱)</span></span
          >, and light green –

            ><span class="magic-box color-17">mizuasagi (水浅葱)</span></span
          >, to yellowish blue –

            ><span class="magic-box color-18">hanaasagi (花浅葱)</span></span
          >, they describe different shades of blue. So do the words for grass
          and flowers. For instance, Kusa (草) is grass in Japanese, and it can
          changed to gusa when it is used as a suffix. The colour names
          constituted with kusa ranged from greenish blue –
          <span class="magic-fade"
            ><span class="magic-box color-19">chigusa (千草)</span></span
          >, dark sky blue –
          <span class="magic-fade"
            ><span class="magic-box color-20">tsuyukus (露草)</span></span
          >, to light blue –

            ><span class="magic-box color-21">wasurenagusa (勿忘草)</span></span
          >. By sharing the same suffix, the names suggested those colours have
          the same hue but appear in different shades.

        <p class="para-text">
          The Japanese language and ‘Ancient languages, like the Assyrian’s, in
          order to name the colour blue, could do no better than transform the
          noun “uknu”, naming lapis lazuli, into an adjective’.<span

            seeing the darkness tint ultramarine each dawn as I sighted the

            Those colours are simple which belong to the elements, fire, air,
            water and earth. For air and water are naturally white in
            themselves, while fire and the sun are golden. The earth is also
            naturally white, but seems coloured because it is dyed. This becomes
            clear when we consider ashes, for they become white when the
            moisture which caused their dyeing is burnt out of them.<span

          I have heard something similar too, maybe once or twice from my
          grandmother. I asked her if the earth is always yellow, she told me,
          ‘maybe not always yellow, after we die, our ashes will be buried into
          the earth, so, there might be some ashy colours too.’. I wasn’t sure
          what she really meant, and I didn’t know that what she wished for was
          her ashes to be buried into the earth after she died, she didn’t want
          to have a tombstone in a cemetery. My mother told me this many years

          My grandmother passed away when I was four years old. I felt
          everything in her house suddenly changed to white because all her
          belongings were covered by the white linens. In China, we had a
          traditional custom of wearing a small black colour square-sleeve on
          the arm for seven days when a family member die, so I had to wear that
          for seven days. Black was not a pleasant colour for me at that young

          I didn’t like white colour either, because in my mind black and white
          are the colours seemed to appear together all the time. They are
          negative, they are colourless, and I didn’t like things that are
          colourless. Even now, I still don’t like black colour, I feel black is
          intense. However, I learned later about the meaning of black in
          Chinese characters. It is not merely a colour. In both Chinese and
          Japanese culture, black stands for darkness, and there are different
          words to describe its density and luminosity. In the West, ‘black was
          a colour, but there was no longer a place for white and black, they
          are out of the chromatic system and outside of the colour world’ after
          Newton’s discovery of the spectrum.<span

          darkness, the fear of night, and the request for light gradually led
          prehistoric and then ancient people to distinguish degrees and

          From a linguistic point of view, ‘The lexicon offers more evidence of
          this diversity in black tones as perceived by ancient people (ancient

          According to Nippon Colors, there are three words to nomenclature
          black in ancient Japanese:

          It says in Chinese classical paintings, sumi (mo in Chinese pinyin)
          has five density levels: burnt, thick, grey, light and clear. By
          creating different layers of density for sumi, not only can the object
          be vividly painted on paper, but the shadows and lights can also be
          shown. And ‘classic Chinese painting’ is what Westerners called it. In
          Chinese, it is called ‘shui mo painting’, a direct translation into
          English would be ‘water ink painting’.

          From the painting classes, I learned how to use white and black as
          subjects. I can still remember what my teachers taught me, she said,
          ‘In order to paint, you have to think of where you are going to keep
          objects “unpainted” – the blank space.’ By saying so, she meant the
          actual blank space on paper and the imagination of where you are going
          to keep audience wondering.

          From the study of the language relationship between black and
          luminosity in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin, Pastoureau concluded: ‘to name
          the color, the parameter of luminosity is more important than that of
          coloration. In the domain of colors the relationship to light takes
          precedence over everything else. That is why even though black is the
          color of darkness, “luminous” blacks exist.’<span

          Luminous black exists in Japanese too, that is – ro, the word often
          used for describing women’s black and silky hair, and a Chinese idiom
          says: ‘It gets luminous when it is too black while brightness results
          in being too white.’

          In Chinese, the idiom ‘either black or white’ is to describe a
          situation where things become too extreme, it is also a phrase to
          advise people to avoid using radical opinions to judge a person or a
          situation. Black and white are also a contrasting pair in Taoism, the
          Taiji symbol of it which the twisted black and white are interlocking,
          symbolising yin (black) and yang (white) energy. The Taiji symbol can
          be interpreted in different aspects, for instance, the most common one
          is Yin stands for feminine energy and yang symbolises male energy, or
          can be read as the white symbol meaning ‘emptiness’ and the black one
          meaning ‘form’ which echoes Buddhism’s ‘Form is Emptiness, Emptiness
          is Form’ in Heart Sutra. No matter what aspect we are looking into,
          overall, it is the concept of balance which Taoism wants us to believe
          that things in the universe merge in their own rhythms and manners, we
          should follow that rhythm and allow them fallen upon us.

          In Junichiro Tanizaki’s ‘In Praise of Shadows’, he described the
          appreciation of darkness in Japanese culture through food and the
          culinary settings: ‘When yokan is served in a lacquer dish within
          those dark recesses, its colour is scarcely distinguishable.<span

          flavour.’<span class="refer-footer-num footer-grey">43</span> And

            and every grain gleaming like a pearl, sends forth billows of warm

          It is not entirely correct to translate the word ‘色’ as colour,
          because ‘色’ has multiple meanings. However, in both Japanese and
          Chinese, the word ‘colour’, ‘sex’ and ‘form’ share the same character
          –‘色’. This lexicon summed up the philosophy of daily life in ancient
          East Asia culture, knowing that we human nature, our instinctive needs
          are eating good food and enjoying the material world. This is where
          the Buddhism comes to the point on ‘form’ and ‘emptiness’, which sees
          the material world is changeable, so is void, then to preach its
          followers: our true happiness and fulfilment should not rely on the
          material (outside) world, the strength comes from one’s inner peace,
          to maintains one’s will power, one needs to give up the desire of
          wanting something. Like any other religion, Buddhism is the belief
          system that people choose to follow. In the end, what is the reality
          of the world we are living is what we choose to see and believe.

          In ‘In Praise of Shadows’, Tanizaki says in ancient Japan ‘Nothing

          lantern, her teeth now and then as the smiles shining a lacquered
          black through lips like elfin fires. It is whiter than the whitest

          In modern Japan, white is a skin tone that Japanese (most of East
          Asian) prefer to have, it is a preference especially for young girls
          because the paler skin a girl has, the prettier she is considered to
          be, and it might suggest she is from a wealthy family.

          It was in summer when I visited Japan, every evening after the sun
          went down, as soon as evening comes, LED lights from thousands of
          billboards started to turn on that illuminated the dark sky,
          especially in Tokyo, I felt the LED lights were never off, the city is
          always ablaze with lights, as if as long as lights illuminated,
          darkness will never come. Leonardo Da Vinci once said ‘light followed

          At the painting class back in primary school, the first few lessons I
          learnt were colours. One of the lessons we did was study on colours
          through different names. A small box that contained twentyish paints
          opened a world of colours to me.
        </p>
        <p class="para-text">
          I like to give colours different names, using my own dictionary, which
          sometimes is in English, and sometimes in Chinese or Japanese, a
          secret game I keep to myself. I started learning English when I was
          eight years old. Red, blue, yellow, white, and black, among the other
          words, they were the first few English vocabularies that I learnt.
          Then, the vocabulary expanded to crimson, vermillion, magenta,
          ultramarine, mauve and so on. The colours became real after being
          translated from my first language. I felt the sensations associated
          with colours diluted through the translation process, at least they
          brought me different sensations when I learnt them. Even red is still
          red, blues have the same blue tones, but they give me different
          sensations in different languages. Learning different languages is not
          only the process of gaining new knowledge, it also allowed me to
          access the feelings which I may have experienced differently from my
          native languages.

          Derek Jarman once said, ‘I know that my colours are not yours. Two
          colours are never the same, even if they’re from the same tube.
          Context changes the way we perceive them.’<span

          It could not be any Truer except when I am thinking of the same
          colours in different languages, because when I close my eyes, I see
          different ‘reds’: red in English is a crimson colour to me, a colour
          that reminds me of the English rose; red in Chinese is a scarlet red;
          red in Japanese is vermillion. I feel Eco’s words, ‘The transformation
          of the sensory stimuli into a percept is in some way determined by the
          semiotic relationship between the linguistic expression and the
          meaning or content culturally correlated to it.’<span

          Language is powerful as well as vulnerable. As Dixon quotes from Eco
          and put it, ‘Umberto Eco says “Verbal language is the most powerful
          and therefore the most familiar instrument” for defining the world, so
          is our chosen system for communicating to one another about the world
          and about the things in it.’<span
            class="refer-footer-num footer-purple"
            >50</span

          Or in Heidegger’s words, ‘Among all the appeals that we human beings,
          on our part, can help to be voiced, language is the highest, and
          everywhere the first.’<span class="refer-footer-num footer-purple"
            >51</span

          It loses its power if the communicating system is not what you are
          most familiar with, though I’m speaking from my very own experience.

          Despite my experiences of different colours and its sensations through
          different languages, ‘It is the society that makes the colour, that
          gives it its vocabulary and its definitions, that constructs its codes
          and values, that organises its uses and determines its stakes.’<span
            class="refer-footer-num footer-purple"
            >52</span

          The colour nomenclature is a social phenomenon, and ‘the more colour
          we find, the more language struggles; the more the space gapes’.
          <span class="refer-footer-num footer-purple">53</span>
        </p>
        <p class="para-text">
          Finding more colours may mean more language struggles, but that might
          not be the case for the Chinese, at least in mainland China. From 1945
          onwards, the simplified language version made the vast number of
          traditional Chinese characters shrink or disappear, like my family
          name – Xiao, which was simplified from the word ‘萧’ to ‘肖’, ‘肖’ has
          no meaning as a single word, it has to combine with other words to
          have meanings. After the simplified Chinese process, the traditional
          word ‘萧’ disappeared in mainland China as a family name. Fortunately,
          traditional Chinese survived outside of mainland China. And colours,
          the richness of the colour nomenclature from the traditional Chinese
          language developed no further but stained the pages of Dream of the
          Red Chambers. No book has ever reached the literature level that Dream
          of the Red Chambers has achieved, at least considering it from a
          linguistic point of view. The novel literately became an encyclopaedic
          book of colour and dyeing techniques. This may has to do with the
          author Cao Xueqin’s family background, which was as one of the biggest
          fabric-making conglomerates in the Qing dynasty, and that could bring
          him first-hand knowledge of dyeing techniques. But mostly it is the
          language level that he mastered. Do you remember the blue colour? –
          ‘sunny sky after rain’ from the Blue chapter, I think this was Cao
          Xueqin’s invention. After him, no one would tell you there is a colour
          as blue as the sky just washed after rain. I see this colour of the
          sky as a light ultramarine blue colour with surrounding clouds, and
          also with sunlight penetrating the clouds, so the sky is covered by
          the sunlight. What is your colour for the ‘sunny sky after rain’?

          With a similar history but ending differently in Japan. Mr. Yoshioka
          Sachio, a master dyer and colour historian, was also the head of the
          fifth generation of the Yoshioka Dyeing Workshop in Kyoto.<span

          His study of art and literature has provided inspiration for the
          colour palettes and methods used in his craft, and he devoted most of
          his time to studying colours, and trying to remake the colours using
          the detailed descriptions of colours and the Heian period court
          apparel from the novel The Tale of Genji. In an interview, he
          explained that he was trying to make the colour purple that was worn
          by Lady Murasaki in the novel.<span

          It was his idea to change the synthetic dye to nature dye in order to
          keep the dyeing technique sustainable. As well as managing the
          family’s dyeing business, Mr. Yoshioka Sachio established a
          publication company where he published books explaining colours, the
          history of colour nomenclature and dyeing techniques.

          We live in a digital age where ‘colours marked with numbers. Panton
          has been invented, they marked on the marking booklets, and labelled
          the designers’ sketch books. We call colours by its numbers.’<span
            class="refer-footer-num footer-purple"
            >56</span

          But through Yoshioka’s dyeing workshop, among others, the dyeing
          techniques have been preserved, and thrived, then diversified, thus
          the colours and their names also have been preserved and expanded too.
          In Japan, these craftsmen are called ‘keepers’, they are not only
          crafting art objects with their speciality, but they are also the
          keepers to protect the arts of making from dying, they make sure that
          the techniques of making art are preserved and transmitted to the next
          generations. By doing so, they wish to keep the spirit of the objects
          that they are making alive, the belief system that come from the
          Shinto culture which rooted in Japanese’s daily life.
        </p>
        <p class="para-text">
          Hiroshi Sugimoto echoes this ‘craftsmen keeper’ spirit through his
          work Colors of Shadow. He asserted that the research methods he
          developed could still be carried on after he died.<span
            class="refer-footer-num footer-purple"
            >57</span

          Sugimoto questioned what science could bring us from discovering the
          seven colour spectrums, and says that despite the scientific discovery
          made us look at the world differently, the world should not be
          measured mathematically because ‘the world is filled with countless
          colours’.<span class="refer-footer-num footer-purple">58</span>
          Sugimoto is romantic, the same as Goethe. Both of them believe colour
          brings emotional sense to us, and he was trying to define (or
          undefine) himself through his own art works by ‘use(ing) virtually
          obsolete Polaroid film to photograph the spans between colours’.<span

          Now we know Goethe’s ‘A color that no one sees is a color that does

          physiological or psychological effects of colors. Our knowledge, our
          sensibility, our present-day “truths” were not those of yesterday, and

              Gozan’ means ‘five mountains’ and ‘Okuribi’ literally is
              translated as ‘sending off fire’. The bonfires are constituted by
              a Japanese kanji character (or a symbol) on each mountain, amongst
              which two of them are identical. The ceremony is a way of honoring
              the family ancestors whose spirits are believed to re-visit the
              world during O-Bon Festive. The Festival is held in August
              annually.
